Project-2
=========

A basic program that plays a variation of nibs.
There is a pile of marbles and some can be removed:
(any number of your choosing)
There is a max predetermined at the start of the game.
The loser is whoever doesn't have a move.
The AI is perfect, though you can choose how far ahead the AI can see
You select:
  the size of the pile
  the max pieces to be removed
  the depth at which the AI searches
  who goes first

Good luck
